to login to AWS CLI
aws.amazon.com/cli
The link will take you to the page that reads AWS Command Line Interface
When you are on the page, on the right pane, you see options to download the CLI for 32 or 64 bit (windows or Linux)
Click on download under windows since we will use the CLI on windows OS. You cannot install the CLI twice.
CLI has to be configured for the user to access the AWS services
CLI has to be configured separately for every user because it has separate and unique access keys for every user.
Configure CLI now by starting the command prompt, in the command prompt
>aws configure --profile classadmin
AWS Access Key ID[None]: paste the access here from xl sheet
AWS Secret Access Key[None]:paste the secret access key here from xl sheet
Default region name[None]:
If you aren't aware of the region name, u may go through this link docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#apigateway_region
The above link is gonna help with the codes of all the regions so u can pick the region and paste it to the CLI
Default output format[None]:enter(no value here)

Now, the CLI is configured for a user and the user can access the AWS from CLI
Test the configured CLI by querying a service which u want to access
>aws s3 ls --profile classadmin1
The above command lists the details related to the s3 service that is mentioned in the command.

Alternatively, check the details of the same service with management console.
login by the username and search for the service s3 and the same objects will reflect under the service.
The only difference is to remember the commands if the services are being accessed by CLI.
